            <p id="description">BU Spark! is seeking mentors to assist student innovators in taking their project ideas to the next level! Spark! Innovation Mentors will guide motivated teams of students participating in BU Spark!’s innovation development programs. In these programs, students engage in a semester-long experience to build a technical product, which can be an app, algorithm, or another creative output. Students will benefit from your expertise to help them develop their ideas, make strategic decisions, and overcome technical barriers.
            
            <br>

            We have two mentoring levels so you can find an option that matches your schedule. Please see below, for descriptions of each of the opportunities.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <button id ="mentorshipfaq-question-1">What is the time commitment?</button>
                <div id="mentorshipfaq-description-1">
                    <p>For Spark! Innovation Coaches, we recommend weekly check-ins (approximately 30-60 minutes per week) with your students, totaling 3-5 hours per month.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For Spark! Innovation Specialists, we ask that you set aside at least 2 hours per month to for students to schedule help sessions from you. You may divide this time how you like. We will assist you with the scheduling process.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <button id ="mentorshipfaq-question-2">Are there any specific requirements to be a Spark! Innovation Specialist?</button>
                <div id="mentorshipfaq-description-2">
                    <p>We recommend that mentors have at least 2 years of experience with a specific library or language to be selected, or experience with the latest innovations or newer technologies. For web and mobile application mentors, mentors should have experience creating the majority of at least one professional quality application. Otherwise, a few years’ working experience with any skill should be sufficient for mentoring.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <button id ="mentorshipfaq-question-3">Do I need to be currently working in the tech industry to be a Spark! mentor?</button>
                <div id="mentorshipfaq-description-3">
                    <p>No, you do not. Industry experience is actually not a direct requirement: university students may also be mentors if they have the appropriate skillsets. Furthermore, If you are seeking to mentor students as a non-technical specialist, such as in Design, UX/UI, Communications or Marketing, it is not required to have experience with the tech industry.</p>

                            <li>Be responsive to students and able to set aside time to meet with student mentees (virtually or in-person)</li>

                            <li>Not seek a formal business partnership with the students</li>

                            <li>Mentors should not violate the CAS/CS Academic Integrity Policy. This is mainly common sense, but the full policy has been linked for your understanding.</li>

                    <p>We are holding mentees to the following standards:</p>

                    <p>We ask that you please focus your time on the student or team assigned to you.

                    <p>We hope that you will be able to help them guide their project to a “minimum viable product” (MVP) – however, we realize that students themselves must take the initiative to finish their projects. Your role is simply to advise them on their journey.</p>

                    <p>You should have access to the students’ code or parts of the code  if it will help you mentor them.  However, your role should remain advisory, rather than a direct role in building the project. </p>
