                <p>Do you have data that needs to be scraped and analyzed? A machine learning model that needs to be improved or tested? An app developed? BU Spark! offers a unique opportunity for organizations to advance their technology projects by partnering with a diverse team(s) of Boston University computer science or engineering students. Through the X-Lab (Experiential Learning) program, students can work on your project as part of a class assignment, consulting job, or during a Hackathon.
                <br><br>
                You can start by filling out a <a href="https://bu-spark.typeform.com/to/FKGRSW">project proposal form</a>. We will then follow up with you for more information, and match your proposed project to a team of BU students.
