If you’re a marketer in a hospital or health system, we feel your pain. You’re likely stuck with outdated systems that don’t let you get the information you need to make informed decisions about how to spend your marketing dollars. Yet simultaneously, you have a CEO or board demanding proof every dollar is working. Rather than let it build to a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, here are a few tips to help you start small, notch some quick wins and build momentum for your efforts. There may not be a silver bullet, but if you’re disciplined about measuring the things you can control, you can glean a lot of insights you might otherwise miss, and build success over time. 

Clearly define your funnel. While awareness may not be the ultimate thing you want to measure – outcomes like appointments are probably more important to your board – knowing the steps to get to a final conversion is crucial. By defining your strategy up front, and aligning your measurement model to it, you’ll be able to make more effective decisions about how each piece of your strategy is working toward the end goals.
